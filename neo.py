# LED strip configuration:
LED_COUNT = 1  # Number of LED pixels.
LED_PIN = 18  # GPIO pin connected to the pixels (18 uses PWM!).
# LED_PIN        = 10      # GPIO pin connected to the pixels (10 uses SPI /dev/spidev0.0).
LED_FREQ_HZ = 800000  # LED signal frequency in hertz (usually 800khz)
LED_DMA = 10  # DMA channel to use for generating signal (try 10)
LED_BRIGHTNESS = 250  # Set to 0 for darkest and 255 for brightest
LED_INVERT = False  # True to invert the signal (when using NPN transistor level shift)
LED_CHANNEL = 0  # set to '1' for GPIOs 13, 19, 41, 45 or 53
LED_STRIP = ws.WS2811_STRIP_GRB  # Strip type and colour ordering





# Main program logic follows:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Process arguments


    # Create NeoPixel object with appropriate configuration.
